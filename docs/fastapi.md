FastAPI Topics to Master for Phase 1 Completion
1. FastAPI Basics
Creating simple API endpoints (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)

Path and query parameters

Request body parsing using Pydantic models

Response models and validation

Handling status codes and exceptions

2. Dependency Injection
Using Depends for reusable dependencies (e.g., database session, authentication)

Injecting services like database connections or configuration

3. Authentication & Authorization
Implementing JWT token authentication (issuing, validating tokens)

Securing routes with OAuth2 or custom security dependencies

Role-based access control (RBAC) basics using dependencies

4. Database Integration
Using MongoDB with FastAPI (e.g., via motor async driver or ODMs like beanie or mongoengine)

Managing database connections and async queries in FastAPI

CRUD operations with MongoDB in async context

5. Middleware & Event Handling
Using middleware for request/response processing (e.g., logging, CORS, authentication)

Startup and shutdown events (e.g., initializing DB connections)

6. Background Tasks
Running background tasks for operations like sending notifications or processing uploads asynchronously

7. File Uploads & Downloads
Handling file uploads (multipart/form-data)

Streaming file downloads and generating pre-signed URLs for Storage Service integration

8. API Documentation
Customizing OpenAPI docs and Swagger UI

Adding metadata, tags, and descriptions for endpoints

9. Testing FastAPI Applications
Writing unit tests for endpoints with TestClient

Mocking dependencies (like DB or auth) for isolated testing

10. Deployment Considerations
Creating Dockerfiles for FastAPI apps

Configuring environment variables securely

Logging best practices in FastAPI apps
