3. Key Azure Services to Consider
Azure App Service — Simple PaaS to host your FastAPI containers or code. Good for MVPs and small projects.

Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) — Managed Kubernetes, ideal for microservices and scale.

Azure Container Registry (ACR) — Store your Docker images privately in Azure.

Azure Cosmos DB (MongoDB API) — Managed MongoDB-compatible database service.

Azure DevOps Pipelines — Build and deploy your app automatically on code commits.

Azure Key Vault — Secure your secrets, API keys, and certificates.

4. Step-by-step High-Level Deployment Workflow
Containerize your FastAPI app using Docker (you likely already have this).

Push your Docker image to Azure Container Registry (ACR).

Create Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster or Azure App Service instance.

Deploy the container to AKS or App Service.

Set up Azure Cosmos DB for your MongoDB backend.

Configure environment variables and secrets via Azure Key Vault or App Settings.

Set up Azure DevOps pipeline to automate build, test, and deployment.

Monitor your app with Azure Monitor and Application Insights.
